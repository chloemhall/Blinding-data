# Blinding-data
Renaming files, using a script in R, to random filenames. For blinding data for analysis. 

All files you wish to convert should be in one single folder. Do not have any files in this folder which you do not wish to rename. 

If you are new to R, a very easy way to set your working directory (setwd) is to use the menu: Session --> Set working directory --> Choose directory ( Or press ^ + shift + H on Mac)
